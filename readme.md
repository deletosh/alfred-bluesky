- Verify your app password is still valid in Bluesky settings
- Try regenerating your app password

**Posts not appearing**
- Check the Bluesky website to verify the post
- Make sure you're connected to the internet
- Try re-entering your credentials

**Having node issues**

### Getting Help

If you run into issues:

2. Create a new issue with:
   - Description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Your macOS and Alfred versions
   - Any error messages (with sensitive info removed)

## Security

- Never share your app password

  - Environment variables (Option A)
  - Local file system (Option B) at `~/.bluesky-credentials.json`
- Only uses app passwords, never your main Bluesky password
